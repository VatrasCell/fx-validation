# fx-validation

JavaFX is a great toolkit for quickly building UIs that look and feel good. But if you have implemente UIs with JSF or JQuery etc, you might be used to a simple way of defining validation rules on UI input elements.
fx-validation is an extension to fx-actions that lets you do just that: declaratively define validation rules on UI controls.
